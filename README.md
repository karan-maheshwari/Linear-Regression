# Linear Regression on Combined Cycle Power Plant data

#### a) Exploratory Data Analsys using Scatterplots, Boxplots and statistical analysis
#### b) Fitting simple linear regression models for all predictors and finding if there exists a statistically significant association between the predictor and the response.
#### c) Fitting a multiple regression model to predict the response using all of the predictors and using null hypothesis to reject insignificant variables.
#### d) Finding non-linear associations between predictors and response variable.
#### e) Checking if there exists interaction terms and their significance level.
#### f) Applying Backward Selection to select the important features.
#### g) Fitting a KNN Regression model and comparing its performace with the Linear Regression Model.
